Purpose and Importance
🎯 Purpose and Importance
The Cuddle Collective was built to address the challenges animal shelters face in managing pets, volunteers, and adoptions. Many shelters struggle with manual record-keeping, scattered volunteer information, and inefficient tracking of pet adoptions.

This application provides a centralized, digital platform to:

Ensure pets are accurately tracked from arrival to adoption

Streamline volunteer management, making it easier to sign up, apply, and connect with shelter staff

Improve communication between admins, volunteers, and pet parents

Increase visibility of available and adopted pets to the public, helping more animals find homes

By combining efficient backend management with a friendly, intuitive frontend, the system not only saves time for shelter staff but also enhances the adoption experience for pet seekers and volunteers, making a tangible difference in the lives of both animals and the community.

Starting Code
🚀 Starting Code
The below section contains our starting point and instructions from the Tech Elevator education team. From this starting point, we built an application that can successfully add or update pets, showcase available pets, display adopted pets, enable users to volunteer, upgrade accounts from user to volunteer using a referral code, view the volunteer directory, etc.

Final Capstone
​This directory contains all of the starter projects for the final capstone.​Each project contains instructions that provides information about the starting code and explains how to get started with the final capstone project.
